# build-my-own-HTTP_SERVER

This project demonstrates how to build a simple HTTP server using NodeJS . The server handles basic HTTP requests, including GET and POST methods, and supports gzip compression if requested by the client. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding low-level network programming and the basics of HTTP protocol implementation.
